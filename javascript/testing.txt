if n <=3 return true
if n>3 and n<= 6, return false
if n % 6 is greater than 3, return false, else true


play optimally;
if n = 4, i take 1-3, friend takes the last one and friend win

if n=5, i take 1, remaining 4, friend takes 1-3, i take either of the last and i win

if n=6, i take 2, remaining 4, friend takes 1-3 and i wan

if n=7, i take 3, remaining 4, friend takes 1-3, i win

if n = 8, i take 3, friend take 1, remainder 4, friend wins

if n=9, i take 1, friend take 1, remainder 6, i win
