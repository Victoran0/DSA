Below is a systematic strategy we would apply for solving problems;
1 State the problem clearlym identify the input and output format
2 Come up with some example inputs and outputs.Try to cover all edge cases
3 Come up with a correct solution for the problem, state it in plain english.
4 Implement the solution and test it using examples inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5 Analyze the algorithms complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6 Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat step 3-6



If interviewers do not give you examples, ask them

We read to understand the problem. analyze our input and output format

If you are not having any ideas, talk with the interviewer, they should give you a hint.


we can list out all the test cases in words, We do not need to create the actual input/output test cases in an interview

Whenever you are in doubt, think about recursion, think if there is a way to solve the problem recursively, which means
can you reduce the overall problem to a combination of one or more sub problem

Copying and pasting takes memory allocation[taking from one and passing to another]

we can print our results per steps for more clarity
