THe time complexity is O(2^m+n)
in our function, we can see that some results are re-occuring.
WE can simply remember our results, this technique is called memoization
We remember this solutions in our dictionary called memo

WE can create zeros 0 in a list by coding;
[0 for x in range(6)] which would gives us zeros in 6 places
but [[0 for x in range(5)] for x in range 6] would give us the 0 in rows and columns

The time complexity of the dynamic programming function we implemented is O(n1*n2)

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(2^N)
