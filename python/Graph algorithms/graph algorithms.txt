We can also use the breadth first search to find out if all the nodes in a graph are connected.

WHen finding the shortest path, if we do not have weights in the graph, then the shortest can be found by performing
breadth first search.
We there are weights no involved, then we can be concerned abut the length of the paths, the numbers of nodes in each path
we need to have a directed graph, we can do this with an undirected graph too.
If it have weights, breadth first search alone may not be enough.

The complexity of breadth first search is o(n+m)

Shortest path can be asked in some really hard interviews, so we can learn it also
